💳 Credit Scoring Model
A machine learning project to predict an individual’s creditworthiness based on past financial data. 
Built as part of my internship Task 1, this project applies classification algorithms to assess whether
A person is a good or risky borrower.

💡 Features

📊 Feature engineering from financial history (income, debts, payment history, etc.)
🧠 Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
📈 Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
🔮 Extendable to more advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
🧾 Insights into factors affecting credit scores
